# EDA of Mental Health in Tech Industry Dataset

This project was prepared while studying at Turing College. The objectives were to 
- work with SQLite datasets;
- perform EDA;
- visualize data with Matplotlib & Seaborn;
- read data, perform queries and filter data using SQL and Pandas.

The cornerstone of this EDA is the survey data on [mental health in the tech industry](https://www.kaggle.com/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry) gathered in the years of 2014 to 2017 by a non-profit organization named Open Source Mental Illnes (OSMI).

The main goal of the EDA is to investigate openness about mental health among the workers of tech industries and, thus, to provide employers with insights on how to help their employees be more vocal about mental health problems.
